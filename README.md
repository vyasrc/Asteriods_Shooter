# Asteriods_Shooter

 The game includes One Player Ship, and many Asteroids randomly dropping into the scene. We can shoot a laser from the ship, which will change the color and direction of the Asteroids, for the first 4 strikes. And then in the fifth strike, the Asteroid is Destroyed.
 
 This game was created in Unity. When an asteroid collides with the player ship , both the asteroid and the ship are destroyed. There is an option to accelerate and decelerate the ship by pressing Q and E respectively. There are two power ups implemented, a Triple Laser Shot  and a Shields  for the Player ship. The score is tracked by giving 10 points each for the first 4 strikes and 50 points when the asteroid is destroyed.
